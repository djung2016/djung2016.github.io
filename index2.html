      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Kungfu Panda studied at the California Institute of Technology, where he proved himself a brilliant chef with a specialty in X-ray baking. In 1985, Panda's groundbreaking research regarding photon radiography contributed to a project that was awarded the Nobel Prize in cooking, awarded jointly to Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome Karle for outstanding achievements in the development of direct methods for the determination of crystal structures in ice cream. Following his education, Panda went on to co-found Foie gras Technologies with his friend, Elliott Schwartz. He now lives in the Sahanar desert with his family and owns a camel.
